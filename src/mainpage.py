# The dueling robot uses a set of tasks to run and target an opponent 
# succesfully. The robot uses MicroPython to control two motors and adjust the
# pitch and yaw axis in order to follow the target found in the provided
# thermal camera. Once the target is located and tracked, the motor engages
# the flywheels and servo motor to propel a dart forward.
