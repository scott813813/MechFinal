RAW VERSION
This version uses a stripped down MLX90640 driver which produces only raw data,
not calibrated data, in order to save memory.

This file contains a wrapper that facilitates the use of a Melexis MLX90640
thermal infrared camera for general use. The wrapper contains a class MLX_Cam
whose use is greatly simplified in comparison to that of the base class,
@c class @c MLX90640, by mwerezak, who has a cool fox avatar, at
@c https://github.com/mwerezak/micropython-mlx90640

To use this code, upload the directory @c mlx90640 from mwerezak with all its
contents to the root directory of your MicroPython device, then copy this file
to the root directory of the MicroPython device.

There's some test code at the bottom of this file which serves as a beginning
example.
